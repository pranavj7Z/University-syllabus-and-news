model of computer, acquisition of data, storage of data, processing of data,
output of processed data. Details of functional units of a computer. Storage
– primary storage and secondary storage.\n
<font fgcolor="aqua">(The discussion should focus more on the functionalities of the units and
their interaction than on specific hardware details. However, concepts like
memory cells and their addressability (need not be binary), registers, interconnections
(buses) have to introduced at an abstract level. For storage
devices – primary and secondary –, various categories have to be
introduced along with their distinguishing features. For I-O devices also,
various categories are to be introduced. The Von Neumann concept should
be effectively introduced. History computers need not be taught. However,
students have to be encouraged to read the relevant sections of the text
book. Chapters 1 – 4 of ‘Goel’ may be used to support teaching -learning.)</font>\n

strengthen the students’ understanding of instruction sequencing. Chapters
1 and 2 of ‘Downey’ have to be covered. Chapter 1 and 2 of ‘Lambert’ can
also be used.) Control statements, Boolean expressions and logical
operators, conditional and alternative executions (Note: - Chapter 4 of
